### tester(obj, hash)

The object should contain functions you want to run. If a "test" in the object fails then it should throw an error.

You can also have async tests by passing in a method with one parameter (done). Then you call `done` once to set a function with more tests/assertions and you call `done` a second time after you asynchronous things have finished.

The optional hash is

	{
        Boolean noReport - a boolean to turn off reporting
        Function cb - a callback to call after async tests are done
    }

tester returns an array of [success, error]
